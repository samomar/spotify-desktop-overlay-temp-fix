# spotify-desktop-overlay-temp-fix
Uses pyautogui to rapidly turn the settings on/off every new session till Spotify get their shit together.

Also requires: cv2, PIL

I'm using multiple sizes to attempt to find/click the logo because it will try to find Spotify's icon anywhere, desktop, taskbar, etc..

You might want to change the index in line 87 based on your settings.
